# Files

### **_GENERAL TODO:_**
### Download images from Google Drive, upload them to this GitHub repository and use the `<img>` tag to place them onto the right HTML pages.
### Create prototypes for 'Live Chat' and 'Resources' that you would be able to access from the floating black sidebar that is displayed on the left side of the screen in the prototype. The sidebar should also have a button that takes you to 'Home', which is probably just the **home.html** page.
### Actually get these files onto the web.

## home.html
Home page for the website. The button takes you to where you can start the survey.

## start_survey.html
Explains the survey. The button takes you to where you can answer the first survey question.

## survey.html
Displays all main survey questions and recommended organizations at the end of the survey.

### **_TODO:_** 
### Make an icon of the letter 'i' inside a circle that appears beneath each button whose term needs to be defined in a popup.

## survey.js
Contains all survey questions and definitions. Determines how they are displayed in **survey.html**.

### **_TODO:_** 
### Find a way to put the variables `surveyArray`, which holds all the survey questions, and the `dictionary`, which holds all the definitions, can be put into a separate file and imported into **survey.js**. Both of those variables take up a lot of lines and should probably be kept separate from the rest of the code.
### Find a way to show pop-ups with definitions for underlined terms other than using `alert()` or `window.open()`. You can't do any styling or add links within popups with either of those methods.

## review.html
Displays all website feedback survey questions. Displays "thank you" message at the end of the feedback survey.

## review.js
Contains feedback questions. Determines how they are displayed in **review.html**.

## style.css
Contains all non-essential styling rules.

### **_TODO:_** 
### Make the styling better match the design of the prototype, starting with the buttons.
