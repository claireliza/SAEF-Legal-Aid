        <h2>Child support:</h2>
        <h3>Child support refers to financial contributions made by a legal parent of a child(s) to the other legal parent in contribution towards the cost of caring for and raising a minor child. Generally speaking, the parent that makes child support payments is the child's non-custodial parent, while the parent that receives the payments is the child's custodial parent.</h3>
        <h2>Custodial parent:</h2>
        <h3>The custodial parent is the legal parent of a child that is primarily responsible for the caretaking functions of a child. In other words, the custodial parent is the parent that is first and foremost the primary caregiver of the child.Similarly, the other legal parent of the child is called the non- custodial parent.</p> <p>The custodial parent can be determined through an allocation of parental responsibilties (custody), which is ordered[court order]through a parenting plan. Otherwise, the child's biological mother is typically made the custodial parent once the child is born.</p> <p>If two parents have joint-custody – or the allocation of parental responsibilties has been distributed evenly – both parents would be the child's custodial parent.</h3>
        <h2 id="established">Established parentage:</h2>
        <h3>Establishing parentage is the process through which one becomes the legal parent of a child. Parentage can be established through one of the following ways: <ul><li>the biological mother having given birth to the child</li> <li>being the presumed parent of the child through a marriage or civil union</li> <li>signing a Voluntary Acknowledgement of Parentage (VAP) for the child</li> <li>legally adopting the child</li> <li>a valid gestational surrogacy agreement; or</li> <li>an adjudication of parentage, either by a judge in court or through the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services(HFS)</li></ul></h3>
