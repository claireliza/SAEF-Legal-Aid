              The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (<a href="#!">HFS</a>) have the
              resources to locate the other parent – even if they live out-of-state
              – establish <a href="#!">legal parentage</a> if needed, and to enter and enforce an
              <a href="#!">adminstrative child support order</a>. To receive these services, you must
              apply to enroll in what is called the <a href="#!">IV-D</a> program, or HFS's child
              support enforcement services. If you are currently receiving <a href="#!">Medicaid</a>
              or <a href="#!">Temporary Assistance to Needy Families</a> (TANF), you are
              automatically enrolled in the IV-D program. If not, you can visit
              HFS's office to apply, or call them to have them send you application
              forms in the mail. IMPORTANT: HFS will need to know any and all
              information about the other parent, such as a last known adress, their
              employer, or any other contact information (phone number, e-mail,
              address of family member). It will also be helpful to have your
              financial information on hand such as copies of recent pay-stubs,
              proof of <a href="#!">LINK/SNAP</a>, or proof of <a href="#!">SSI</a>.

              CLC...: If you are denied enrollment in HFS's IV-D program – otherwise
              known as child support enforcement services – these legal service
              agencies can assist you in obtaining a judicial child support order,
              but ONLY IF you know the exact address for the other parent's current
              place of residence. IMPORTANT: An exact address is necessary for these
              agencies to assist you: They will help you file a petition and a
              praecipe of summons, which requires service of process, and then you
              will eventually have your case heard in front of a judge.
              Additionally, any medical records concerning the birth of the child,
              especially the birth certificate, will also be useful. It will also be
              helpful to have your financial information on hand such as copies of
              recent pay-stubs, proof of LINK/SNAP, or proof of SSI.
