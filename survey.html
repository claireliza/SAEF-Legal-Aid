        <h2>Healthcare & Family Services</h2>
        <p> The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services HFS have the resources to locate the other parent – even if they live out-of-state – establish legal parentage if needed, and to enter and enforce an adminstrative child support order. To receive these services, you must apply to enroll in what is called the IV-D program, or HFS's child support enforcement services. If you are currently receiving Medicaid or Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), you are automatically enrolled in the IV-D program. If not, you can visit HFS's office to apply, or call them to have them send you application forms in the mail. IMPORTANT: HFS will need to know any and all information about the other parent, such as a last known adress, their employer, or any other contact information (phone number, e-mail, address of family member). It will also be helpful to have your financial information on hand such as copies of recent pay-stubs, proof of LINK/SNAP, or proof of SSI. </p>

        <p>CLC...: If you are denied enrollment in HFS's IV-D program – otherwise known as child support enforcement services – these legal service agencies can assist you in obtaining a judicial child support order, but ONLY IF you know the exact address for the other parent's current place of residence. IMPORTANT: An exact address is necessary for these agencies to assist you: They will help you file a petition and a praecipe of summons, which requires service of process, and then you will eventually have your case heard in front of a judge. Additionally, any medical records concerning the birth of the child, especially the birth certificate, will also be useful. It will also be helpful to have your financial information on hand such as copies of recent pay-stubs, proof of LINK/SNAP, or proof of SSI.</p>
